UNKNOWN COMMANDS
----------------
If the bot doesn't recognize a command, it will respond with:
  "🤔 I didn't understand that command. Try:
   • 'check inventory' - See current stock
   • 'add X crates' - Add X crates to inventory
   • 'added X beers' - Remove X beers when added to fridge"


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
- All commands are case-insensitive
- The bot uses natural language processing
- Commands work with partial phrases (e.g., "how many" triggers inventory check)
- Inventory is stored in inventory.json file (crates only, no partial beers)
- Default starting inventory: 50 crates (configurable in .env file)
- Recommended: Use "add X crates" for adding inventory (primary method)
- Alternative: "add X beers" converts to crates (only full crates added)
- Distinction between ADD and SUBTRACT:
  * "add X crates" or "added X crates to inventory" = ADD to inventory
  * "add X beers" or "added X beers to inventory" = ADD to inventory (converts to crates)
  * "added X beers" (to fridge) or "removed X beers" = SUBTRACT from inventory
